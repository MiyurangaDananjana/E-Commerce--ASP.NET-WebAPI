# E-Commerce Web API with ASP.NET, JWT Authentication, and Entity Framework

This repository contains a web API implementation for an E-Commerce web application built with ASP.NET. The API incorporates JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for secure user authentication and authorization. Additionally, it utilizes Entity Framework, an object-relational mapper, to interact with the underlying database.

Features
ASP.NET Web API: The E-Commerce web API is developed using ASP.NET, a robust and scalable framework for building web applications. ASP.NET provides a wide range of features and tools to streamline the development process.

JWT Authentication: JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication is implemented to ensure secure user authentication and authorization. JWTs are used to generate and verify tokens, allowing users to access protected API routes.

Entity Framework: Entity Framework is an object-relational mapper that simplifies database interactions by providing a high-level abstraction layer. It allows you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database using object-oriented paradigms.

Secure Authentication: JWT authentication adds an extra layer of security to your E-Commerce web API. It helps prevent unauthorized access to protected resources and mitigates the risk of data tampering.
